# Gradient Circle

Gradient Circle is an exceptional NFT crafted entirely with the aid of AI technology. This project was initiated with the intention of facilitating NFT minting on testnets, serving as a valuable resource for developers looking to expedite their application development process. By eliminating the need to deploy their own testnet contracts, developers can seamlessly create NFTs at no cost on any EVM-compatible blockchain, be it a testnet or mainnet. "Gradient Circle" empowers developers to enhance their efficiency and accelerate their progress.

This GitHub project contains two sub-repositories: the Image Generator and the NFT Mint smart contract Hardhat repository.
